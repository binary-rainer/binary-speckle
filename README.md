# binary-speckle

This is my program package to search for binary stars in speckle or
Adaptive Optics data.

Compared to the version of 2002, this version has some minor updates
and bugfixes.

Documentation isn't here yet.  You can look for it in the software
repository of the Center for Adaptive Optics
(http://cfao.ucolick.org).
