  <H1>Finding out if a star has no companions</H1>

  If you think an object is unresolved, or you want to find out if a
  binary hasn't any more companions, you should run
  <KBD>maxbright</KBD> to find out how bright a companion can be that
  would be hidden in the noise.  You can call it from mcspeckle by
  clicking on "Call maxbright", or from binplot with menuitem "Call
  maxbright", or from the command line:
  <PRE>
    maxbright -root filename.fits_ -title "this is an example"
  </PRE>
  "filename" is the name of the average files you specified when you
  told mcspeckle to create averaged files, and the title will be
  printed at the top of the PS-file if you print the result of
  maxbright.
  <P>
  Here is a scaled-down copy of maxbright's window:

  The principle of the maxbright-algorithm is to determine how far the
  data deviate from the nominal result for a point source (visibility
  = 1.0, phase = 0.0) and then to determine the upper limit of the
  brightness for a companion that would result in just this amount of
  change in visibility or phase.
  </P>
  To explain this in more detail, let's go back to 1-dimensional scans
  for the moment.  The 1-dimensional visibility of a real unresolved
  star (RXJ1539.0-2956, see K&ouml;hler et al. 2000) looks like this:
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="Maxbright_1Dvis.gif">
  <P>
  Notice the vertical scale is from 0.8 to 1.1, this is about as
  close to "flat" as speckle observations usually get.  Now we
  consider the value and error of each point and assume this to be the
  minimum of the visibility curve of a binary.  For example, the curve
  for the point at 21.3 looks like this:
  </P>
  <IMG SRC="Maxbright_1Dvis+3pix.gif">
  <P>
  (This plot was made with <KBD>binplot</KBD>, which plots positive and negative
  spatial frequencies.  <KBD>Maxbright</KBD> plots only positive frequencies,
  since the visibility is symmetrical.)
  </P>
  This curve corresponds to a binary with separation 3 pixel and a
  flux ratio of 0.017.  A brighter companion would lead to a higher
  amplitude of the visibility, which is clearly not consistant with
  the data.  <KBD>Maxbright</KBD> repeats this for the data points at all
  frequencies and combines this to a "maxbright"-curve:
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="Maxbright_1D.gif">
  <P>
  At 3 pixels separation, one can find our result of 0.017.
  </P>
  A similar method is used to derive limits from the phase.
  <P>
  For 2-dimensional data, we reduce it to one dimension by averaging
  over one direction.  This is not a simple cut through the image, it
  really means adding all pixels in one direction and then dividing by
  the number of pixels.  Of course, we lose the spatial resolution in
  this direction, therefore we have to repeat this in several
  directions to exclude companions at all position angles.  <KBD>Maxbright</KBD>
  does this automatically, it is possible to set starting and ending
  position angle, and the step size.  The default is to consider
  position angles from 0 to 180 degrees in steps of 10 degrees.  Since
  the fourier transform of a real image is hermitian, we would not get
  additional information from position angles larger than 180 degrees.
  <P>
  A more important parameter is the size of the area used for the
  average.  Features smaller than the diffraction limit of the
  telescope cannot be reconstructed.  The diffraction limit
  corresponds to a certain spatial frequency in Fourier space.  For
  frequencies larger than this, our data does not contain any
  information about the object observed, but only noise.  This can
  clearly be seen in the visibility of RXJ1539.0-2956:
  </P>
  <IMG SRC="RXJ1539.0_tvis.gif">
  <P>
  Because of this, it is important to use only data points within a
  certain radius.  (Since the mirrors of today's telescopes are
  round, the diffraction limit and the maximal spatial frequency do
  not depend on the position angle.  I will have to change the program
  if I get data that was obtained through both mirrors of the LBT...)
  However, the radius where the signal-to-noise ratio becomes too bad
  depends not only on the diffraction limit of the telescope, but also
  on the atmospheric conditions during the observations.  Therefore
  one has to inspect the data and set the maximum radius accordingly.
  </P>
  With adaptive optics data, there often is another problem.  If the
  quality of the correction on object and reference is different,
  there is a ring-like structure in the visibility.  The visibility
  has a local minimum at the center and rises towards larger
  frequencies.  In normal space, this would correspond to a brightness
  distribution with negative brightness at some points, which is
  clearly not reasonable (unless someone finds an object that emits a
  negative number of photons).  The maxbright-algorithm described
  above yields limits that are negative, but <KBD>maxbright</KBD> ignores them
  and inserts 0 instead.  At the moment, the only solution to this
  problem is to mask out the local minimum in the center by using a
  minimal radius for the area used.  This has to be done by the user,
  <KBD>maxbright</KBD> itself is not (yet) clever enough to detect this!
  Here is an example of one of those bad visibilities:
  <P>
  <img src="bad_ao_vis.gif">
  <P>
  You might have noticed that most of the work the user has to do with
  <KBD>maxbright</KBD> is to find the optimal combination of minimum
  and maximum radius.  There is special function in the program to
  find the maxima of the maxbright-curves for a range of radii.  This
  function is called by selecting "Max from distance" in the "file"
  menu.  A small window opens that allows to specify the range of
  radii used:
  </P>

  <P>
  The "Min. Sep. of Companion" should be the number of pixels
  corresponding to the diffraction limit of the telescope.  Of course,
  this depends on the wavelength, the size of the telescope, and the
  pixel scale of the camera, which is unknown to <KBD>maxbright</KBD>.
  The result will be a table like this:

  In this case, I would not trust the value of 0.05997 for a maximum
  radius of 40.  In K&ouml;hler et al. 2000, we quote a more
  conservative limit of 0.07 instead.  In our speckle multiplicity
  surveys, we reached a limit of 0.1 for all the stars in the survey,
  so we consider everything better than 0.1 to be good enough.
