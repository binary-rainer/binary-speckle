  <H2>Introduction</H2>

  I started working on this package during my PhD thesis, which
  consisted of a speckle multiplicity survey among T Tauri Stars in
  Taurus-Auriga and Scorpius-Centaurus.  We also had the opportunity
  to do AO observations of some of the stars, and since we didn't have
  a better program, we used the speckle program to reduce this data.
  Since then, the program has been used for speckle surveys of young
  stars in Chamaeleon and Ophiuchus and old stars in the galactic
  halo, and for a survey using Adaptive Optics of young stars in
  Lupus.
  <P>
  Publications describing the method are of course

  The latter paper contains an especially comprehensive explanation
  and some examples, so I include it in the tar-file of the package
  (<A HREF="AA1668E.PDF">here is the PDF-file</A>).

  <H2>Prerequisites</H2>
  Unfortunately, this program relies on a couple of other packages.
  Fortunately, these packages are freely available, some of them
  are usually already installed on a linux system.

  <UL>
    <LI> A C-compiler <BR>
      I used the GNU compiler most of the time, but any compiler that
      understands ANSI-C <i>should</i> work.
    </LI>
    </P>

    <LI> Tcl/Tk
      <TABLE>
	<TR><TD>Version:     </TD><TD>8.x (tested with 8.0 and 8.3)</TD></TR>
	<TR><TD>Available at:</TD>
	  <TD><A HREF="http://www.scriptics.com">http://www.scriptics.com</A></TD></TR>
      </TABLE>
      Please note that we also need the tcl/tk-libraries.
      It's not sufficient to have the "wish" program only!
      Usually already installed on Linux.
    </LI>
    </P>

    <LI> GNU make </LI>
    <TABLE>
      <TR><TD>Version:	   </TD><TD>3.79</TD></TR>

    </TABLE>
    This is not only used for compilation, but also during data reduction!
    Usually already installed on Linux.
    </P>

    <LI> SAOimage DS9 and XPA </LI>
    <TABLE>
      <TR><TD>Version:	   </TD><TD>1.9.8 or 2.0 (DS9), 2.0.3 (XPA)</TD></TR>

	      http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9</A></TD></TR>
    </TABLE>
    In order to use the xpa-protocol on SuSE linux, we had to set
    the environment-variable XPA_METHOD to "local".  In the csh or
    tcsh shell, this is done with:
    <PRE>      setenv XPA_METHOD local</PRE>
    In the bash shell, use
    <PRE>      export XPA_METHOD=local</PRE>
    </P>

    <LI> FFTW </LI>
    <TABLE>
      <TR><TD>Version:	   </TD><TD>2.1.3</TD></TR>
      <TR><TD>Available at:</TD>
	<TD><A HREF="http://www.fftw.org">http://www.fftw.org</A></TD></TR>
    </TABLE>
    This is used during the deconvolution only.  Of course, that is
    probably the most important part of the program.
    </P>

    <LI> PGPLOT </LI>
    <TABLE>
      <TR><TD>Version:	   </TD><TD>5.2.0</TD></TR>

    </TABLE>
    The programs <KBD>tkfmovie</KBD>, <KBD>binplot</KBD>, and
    <KBD>maxbright</KBD> use the <KBD>/PS</KBD> and the
    <KBD>/XTK</KBD> drivers.  If those drivers are not installed, you
    have to install them, which might require a complete
    re-installation of PGPLOT.  You need a FORTRAN compiler to install
    it from the source.  Here is the
    <A HREF="drivers.list"><KBD>drivers.list</KBD></A> I used when I
    installed PGPLOT.

    <LI> netpbm </LI>
    <TABLE>
      <TR><TD>Version:	</TD><TD>probably not important</TD></TR>

    </TABLE>
    Used only to create a hardcopy of the results, and only the
    <KBD>pnmtops</KBD> program is needed.  The README file in the
    netpbm package explains how you can compile only one program.
  </UL>

 <!--
  If you want to use the <KBD>amf</KBD> program, you also need the
  source code of the Numerical Recipes in C.  (<KBD>amf</KBD> uses the
  amoeba algorithm to determine the parameters of a binary.  There is
  also another program to do this without using Numerical Recipes
  Code, but it is <strong>much</strong> slower.)  Unfortunately, we
  are not allowed to distribute the source code of Numerical Recipes
  routines.  However, we are allowed to distribute executable, so we
  might be able to help you.  Just contact me
  (<A HREF="mailto:rkoehler@ucsd.edu">rkoehler@ucsd.edu</A>).

      -->
    <LI>
      Edit the Makefile in the Binary-Speckle directory.  The most
      important change is to enter the locations of Binary-Speckle
      itself, Tcl/Tk,  FFTW, and PGPLOT.
      There is a section with machine-specific settings for Linux,
      Solaris, and HP-UX, uncomment the entries appropriate for your
      machine.  The current version has only been tested on Linux and
      Solaris 8, but older versions ran on other Solaris versions and
      HP-UX.  Please tell us if you have to change something.<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Type:
      <PRE>
	make
	make install
      </PRE>
      This should compile everything and put the executable programs
      into the toplevel directory.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      You have to add the top-level directory to your path-variable,
      so the shell is able to find the programs.  This is done best by
      editing <KBD>.cshrc</KBD> (for tcsh-users) or
      <KBD>.profile</KBD> (for bash-users) in your home-directory.

  <H3>Documentation</H3>

  The function of the package can be divided into three tasks:
  <OL>
    <LI>Reduce the raw data to deconvolved fourier-transformed
      images</LI>
    <LI>Determine the parameters of a binary or triple</LI>
    <LI>Find limits for the brightness of an undetected companion</LI>
  </OL>
  There are several different programs required to do this, and the
  connections between them are probably not easy to understand at
  first sight.
  <P>
  The principle is (hopefully) pretty simple:  There is a master
  program called "<KBD>mcspeckle</KBD>" ("mouse controlled speckle",
  since its predecessor didn't have a graphical user interface).  The
  user tells mcspeckle which data files to use, what is in the files
  (objects, sky etc.), and what should be done.  Mcspeckle than
  (usually) creates a Makefile, i.e. an input file for the
  <KBD>make</KBD> program that contains all the dependancies between
  the different data files and the commands needed to do the data
  reduction.  <KBD>Make</KBD> then decides what has to be done to
  create the final results.  In the good (?) old days, when one data
  reduction ran the whole night and quite often ended with a "disk
  full error", this was very useful.  One could simply fix the problem
  and run <KBD>make</KBD> again.  <KBD>Make</KBD> then checked
  which files were up to date und ran only the commands for the files
  that had not yet been reduced.  The user shouldn't have to fiddle
  with the contents of the makefiles.
  <P>
  Of course, someone has to do the work of reading the data, doing
  something with it, and writing the results to another file.  This
  is the task of most of the other programs in the package
  (<KBD>despeckle</KBD>, <KBD>findcenter</KBD>, <KBD>fits2pnm</KBD>,
  <KBD>fitsmean</KBD>, <KBD>maskedit</KBD>, <KBD>prespeckle</KBD>,
  <KBD>quickvis</KBD>, <KBD>saa</KBD>, and <KBD>tkfmovie</KBD>).
  Some of them have their own graphical interface to let the user
  adjust something, but most of them are simply called by
  <KBD>make</KBD> or from the shell, and accept only command line
  options.  The most important option is "-h", which will show all the
  other options.
  <P>
  Furthermore, there are <KBD>binplot</KBD>, <KBD>amf</KBD>, and
  <KBD>bff</KBD>, which fit a binary or triple model to the data.
  Finally, <KBD>maxbright</KBD> calculates limits for undetected
  companions.
