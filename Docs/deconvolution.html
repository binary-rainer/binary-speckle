  <H1>How to find a binary (or find out if a star is not a binary)</H1>

  <H4>Required observations</H4>

  For speckle-interferometry (and AO observations that shall be
  reduced like speckle observations), one needs essentially three
  kinds of data:
  <OL>
   <LI>observations of the object</LI>
   <LI>observations of the (PSF-)reference</LI>
   <LI>observations of the blank sky</LI>
  </OL>
  In speckle-interferometry, each "observation" consists of a few hundred
  single exposures with integration times shorter than one second.  With
  Adaptive optics, one can integrate longer and take fewer exposures.
  Our experience shows that the integration times should not be longer than
  about 3 seconds, since otherwise the speckle method for data reduction
  doesn't work.  However, this shouldn't be a problem for stars bright enough
  to be observed with AO.
  <P>
  The data should be stored in FITS cubes, i.e. three-dimensional FITS files,
  where the single exposures are stacked along the third axis.
  <P>
  The IR-cameras we used in the past are made up of four quadrants.  Since
  the transition between the quadrants is not perfectly smooth, it is a good
  idea to put the star not in the center of the entire frame, but in the
  center of one of the quadrants.  Another advantage of this is that we get
  three quadrants with blank sky for free during the observation of the
  target.  However, we need a sky observation done in the same quadrant as
  the star, since we create the badpixel mask from the sky observation.
  Therefore we observe the object at least twice, once in one quadrant, the
  second time in another quadrant.  The same is done during the observation
  of the reference star.  So, in the end we have at least four data cubes,
  where a single frame of each cube looks like this:
  </P>
  <IMG SRC="rawframe1.gif">
  <IMG SRC="rawframe2.gif">
  <IMG SRC="rawframe3.gif">
  <IMG SRC="rawframe4.gif">
  <P>
  Sometimes one wants to go back to the object and take more observations of it.
  Sometimes it is possible to use the same reference for more than one target.
  Therefore one might end up with more data cubes, but the general principle
  remains the same.
  <P>
  One final remark about observations: mcspeckle uses the OBJECT keyword in
  the FITS-header to help you decide which files to use for which purpose.
  Although it is not strictly necessary, it makes life much easier if you
  enter useful object names during the observations.

  <H3>Selection of data files and Prereduction</H3>

  So, assuming you came back from your observing run with a bunch of
  data files you want to reduce.  In the first part of the data
  reduction, you have to
  <UL>
    <LI>select the data files that will be used,</LI>
    <LI>specify what they contain,</LI>
    <LI>decide which sky is used for each data cube,</LI>
    <LI>set the parameters for the detection of badpixels, and</LI>
    <LI>select the flatfield file (if you want to use one).</LI>
  </UL>
  <P>
  To keep things halfway organized, we recommend to put the files that
  belong together into one directory (i.e. the observations of an
  object, the corresponding reference, and possibly other objects that
  should  be reduced with the same reference).  Then, cd to this
  directory and start mcspeckle by typing
  <PRE>
    mcspeckle
  </PRE>
  It should open a small window and ask for the names of the data files:<P>
  <IMG SRC="Filter.gif">
  <P>
  You don't have to enter the filenames individually (in fact, you
  can't), but a pattern that describes them all.  The default is
  "*.fits", you can enter something else, or pick one out of a list of
  predefined patterns that appears if you click on the button with the
  arrow at the right.  If you click on "Ok", mcspeckle reads all files
  matching the pattern and creates a list with several controls for
  each data file:
  </P>
  <A NAME="split"></A>
  <IMG SRC="Split.gif">
  <P>
  In the upper right corner of each box is a button labeled "Display"
  that will do just that: display this file in <KBD>ds9</KBD>.  If
  <KBD>ds9</KBD> is not yet running, it will be started, otherwise the
  running <KBD>ds9</KBD> is told to display the file.  You are looking
  at the raw data with all the bad pixels, therefore you should set
  the scaling in <KBD>ds9</KBD> to "zscale" to see the star.
  <P>
  In the bottom row, there are some pop-up menus where you tell mcspeckle how
  this file should be split and used.
  <DL>
    <DT>Used Area</DT>
    <DD>If you positioned the star in, say, the upper and lower left
      quadrants, it would be a waste of CPU time and disk space to
      reduce the full frame.  Here you can select which part of the
      frame should be used.  You can select the left, right, top, and
      bottom half, the full frame, or several special areas that are
      useful for data obtained with the ADONIS system.  ADONIS appends
      one row at the top of each image to store some additional
      information.  The ADONIS-areas throw this row away and use only
      the image part of each frame.
    </DD>
    <P>
    <DT>Split</DT>
    <DD>This menu determines how mcspeckle will split the used area of
      the frames.  "Vertical" means the area will be split into top
      and bottom half, "Horizontal" into left and right half,
      "Bot.lft/Top rgt" uses only the lower left and upper right
      quarter of the area, while "Bot.rgt/Top lft" uses only the lower
      right and upper left quadrant.  Finally, "not at all" doesn't
      split the used area, but gives you one data file.<BR>
      Note that the titles of the next two menus will adjust according
      to the setting of "Split".
    </DD>
    <P>
    <DT>Top (or Left or Bot.Left or Bot.Right or Whole)</DT>
    <DD>This setting tells mcspeckle what is in the corresponding part
      of the frame.  You can choose between "Object", "Object sky",
      "Reference", "Reference Sky", "Object + Reference Sky", and
      "Nothing".  The last setting is sometimes useful if parts of the
      image can't be used for some reason.  The distinction between
      object and reference sky is somewhat arbitrary.  With the
      observation scheme described above, one has sky observations
      that are used only for the reduction of the object observations,
      and skies that are used only for the reference.  It might seem
      easier to use the setting "Object + Reference Sky", however,
      will make things even more complicated since the program doesn't
      know which sky to use.
    </DD>
    <P>
    <DT>&lt;-&gt;</DT>
    <DD>Clicking on this button will exchange the settings of the
      menus to its left and right.
    </DD>
    <P>
    <DT>Bottom (or Right or Top Right or Top Left)</DT>
    <DD>Same as "Top", but for the second part of the frames.  If the
      frames are not split, this setting is ignored.
    </DD>
  </DL>
  <P>
  At the top of the window are three menus that can be used to quickly
  adjust several settings at once.  "All Areas..." and "Split all..."
  set the "Used Area" and "Split" menus of all data files to the same
  value.  In the "Reference" menu, you can set which objects should be
  used as reference stars.  This relies on the OBJECT keyword in the
  FITS-header.
  <P>
  With our example data, you just have to use the "Reference" menu to
  make "P129984" the reference star.
  <P>
  At the bottom of the window are two buttons that will abort the
  program or take you to the next step.  Clicking on "Next Step:
  Assigns" will close the window and open another:
  </P>
  <A NAME="assign"></A>
  <IMG SRC="Assigns-Pre.gif">
  <P>
  Every object data file will have one sky and one reference data file
  assigned to it.  Likewise, every reference file will have one sky
  file.  There are several pop-up menus that allow you to set these.
  At this point in the data reduction, the skies are used to find bad
  pixels and subtract the background.  Therefore you should assign sky
  files that cover the same area on the chip as the corresponding
  object or reference file.  To make the decision easier, mcspeckle
  appends the letters "t", "b", "l", and "r" to the filenames of the
  top, bottom, left, and right parts.  Furthermore, it creates the
  directories "obj", "osky", "ref", and "rsky", and sorts its output
  files into them.
  </P>
  Below the pop-up menus are two buttons.  "Same Sky-#" will set all
  skies so that the first object is assigned to the first sky, the
  second object to the second sky, and so on.  "Crossed Sky" assignes
  the first object to the second sky, the second object to the first
  sky, and so on.  With the standard observation scheme described
  above, this results in the assignments of objects and skies covering
  the same area on the chip.  Mcspeckle initially uses this setting.
  <P>
  Further down are again two buttons that abort the program or
  continue to the next step.  This will close the window and open yet
  another one:
  </P>
  <A NAME="prereduction"></A>
  <IMG SRC="Prereduction.gif">
  <P>
  Now we come to the details of what we call "prereduction", that is
  sky-subtraction, flatfielding, creation of the badpixel mask etc.
  </P>
  If "remove bad frames" is activated, the program will try to detect
  and remove bad frames.  This is done by computing the average of all
  pixel values in all frames and then comparing the average of each
  individual frame to it.  Frames deviating by more than 3 sigma will
  be removed.
  <P>
  "Badpixmask options" are the options passed to the prespeckle
  program when it creates the badpixel mask from the sky.  To create
  the badpixel mask, every pixel is compared to the average of the
  pixels in a box around it.  Pixels that deviate by more than a
  specified number of sigmas are marked as bad.  This is repeated
  several times, omitting known badpixels when computing the average.
  If the box contains not enough good pixels, its size will be
  increased up to a certain maximum.  In order to avoid marking too
  many pixels as bad, one can set a fraction of the total number of
  pixels in the frame as upper limit.  If the program detects more
  badpixels, it increases the number of sigmas a pixel is allowed to
  deviate and tries again.  Nearly every parameter can be set in this
  algorithm, here is a list of all the options (default values are in
  square brackets):
  <PRE>
    -nsigm n        minimal no. of sigmas a bad pix must deviate [3.0]
    -boxr r         min. radius of the box used to compute the mean [3]
    -maxbox r       max. radius of the box used to compute the mean [12]
    -steps s        maximal number of steps [5]
    -badfrac f      maximal fraction of bad pixels in the frame [50]
    -im mask        name of predefined mask
    -c coord-list   ascii-file containing known bad pixels
    -r region       saoimage-region containing known bad pixels
  </PRE>
  You can also give a predefined mask with known badpixels.  This
  should be a FITS-file where good pixels have a value of zero and
  badpixels some value other than zero.  The data in the file should
  be in integer format, since zeroes in floating point format
  sometimes turn out as not exactly zero due to rounding errors.  The
  filename of the predefined mask can be entered in the field next to
  the button labeled "Predef.Badpixmask:", but it's probably easier to
  click on the button and select the mask from the menu that pops up.
  This menu contains all files in the "Masks" subdirectory in the
  Binary-Speckle directory.
  <P>
  In the next line, you can enter the filename of the flatfield or
  select it from the menu.  This menu contains all files in the
  "Flats" subdirectory in the Binary-Speckle directory.  We hardly
  ever used flatfields for speckle observations, therefore we didn't
  include one in the example data set.  A good flatfield
  doesn't hurt, but it also doesn't improve the result very much.
  </P>
  The last line in the window contains three buttons.  "Write
  Makefile" will write the makefile for the prereduction (it is called
  "<KBD>prered.make</KBD>").  If you wish, you can leave mcspeckle and
  start the prereduction by typing "<KBD>./prered.make</KBD>" or
  "<KBD>gmake -f prered.make</KBD>" (if GNU make is called gmake on
  your computer).  The "Go!" button will write the makefile and
  immediately start it.  "Exit" will leave mcspeckle without doing
  anything.  All your settings will be lost in this case!
  <P>
  If you click on "Go!", mcspeckle iconifies itself to show the shell
  window where it was started.  In this window appears a lot of text
  output from the programs that actually do the data reduction.  If
  all goes well, finally the mcspeckle-window reappears in a new shape.
  </P>
  If you quit mcspeckle and start the prereduction from the command
  line, you can restart mcspeckle and continue the data reduction by
  typing
  <PRE>
    mcspeckle Main.grp
  </PRE>
  The mcspeckle-window then looks like this:
  </P>
  <IMG SRC="Main.gif">
  <P>
  This is a list of buttons that start the different steps in the data
  reduction. "Select Datafiles" leads back to the steps we just did.
  "Add Bad Pixels" is the topic of the next section, the other buttons
  will be explained later.

  <H3>Marking additional bad pixels</H3>

  Although the algorithm to detect badpixels is quite complex, it
  usually doesn't find all of them.  Therefore it is a good idea to
  inspect the data files and mark additional badpixels by hand.  If
  you click on "Add Bad Pixels", another window appears:
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="AddBadPix.gif">
  <P>
  At the same time, an average frame of the first data cube will be
  displayed in <KBD>ds9</KBD>.  To see badpixels, it is usually best
  to set the scaling in <KBD>ds9</KBD> to "minmax" and "log". You
  probably want to increase the zoom-factor, too.  To mark a badpixel,
  set "region" to "point" and simply click on the pixel.  If you
  marked all bad pixels in an image, click on "Correct Badpixels" in
  mcspeckle's window.  It will read the list of regions set in
  <KBD>ds9</KBD>, mark the pixels in the badpixel mask, correct them
  in the image, and finally display it again in <KBD>ds9</KBD>.  You
  can repeat this as often as you wish.  To go to the next data cube,
  click either on its name or on the "Next" button in mcspeckle's
  window.
  </P>
  When you checked all data cubes, click on "Done".  Mcspeckle will
  ask if it should correct the badpixels in the data cubes now.  So
  far, only the badpixels in the average frames have been corrected to
  make the procedure faster.  You can click on "Yes" to run the
  badpixel correction immediately, or come back later and start it
  from mcspeckle's main menu.  The mcspeckle window will be iconified
  again, while the data-reduction programs do their work and print
  their output to the text window.
  <P>
  The badpixel correction is one of the times when <KBD>make</KBD>
  comes in handy: If you didn't mark any additional pixels in a data
  file, <KBD>make</KBD> will detect this and not waste time with it.

  <A NAME="tkfmovie"></A>
  <H3> Watching FITS movies </H3>

  Now is the time to check if all the frames are good enough to be
  used for the deconvolution.  With the fast read-out necessary for
  speckle-interferometry, it happens quite often that the IR camera
  starts sending garbage in the middle of a data cube.  During AO
  observations, sometimes the AO system fails to keep the loop closed.
  <P>
  To make the inspection of hundreds to thousands of frames easier,
  we have a special program called "<KBD>tkfmovie</KBD>" that will
  display them like a movie.  The easiest
  way to start it is to click on "Show Movies" in mcspeckle.  The
  window that comes up looks like this:
  </P>
  <IMG SRC="tkfmovie.gif">
  <P>
  If your terminal can display only 256 colors, it can happen that
  <KBD>tkfmovie</KBD> refuses to start because it cannot allocate
  enough colors.  Try to close programs that use a lot of colors,
  like ds9, netscape, xv, or ghostview, and try to call
  <KBD>tkfmovie</KBD> again.
  <P>
  The basic operation of <KBD>tkfmovie</KBD> is pretty simple.  The
  buttons below the image move to the first frame in the cube, play
  the movie backwards, go one frame backwards or forwards, play the
  movie forwards, or go to the last frame in the cube.  While the
  movie is playing, the play button will change to a stop button.  To
  change the speed of the movie, adjust the "Delay" value in the lower
  right of the window. This is the time in milliseconds the program
  waits after a frame was displayed.
  <P>
  If you found a frame you want to delete from the data cube, select
  "Mark for deletion" in the "Edit" menu.  If you marked all bad
  frames, select "Delete now" in the same menu.  Don't forget to save
  the data cube afterwards ("Save" in the "File" menu).  It will warn
  you that the file already exists and give you the choice to
  overwrite or rename it.
  <P>
  When <KBD>tkfmovie</KBD> is started, it will show the data in the
  first file. To switch to another file, select one from the "List of
  files" menu.

  <H3> Deconvolution </H3>

  When you are happy with all the frames, you can prepare the
  deconvolution.  In this part of the data reduction, you have to
  <UL>
    <LI>change the assignments of skies and references to
      objects,</LI>
    <LI>select subframes around the objects,</LI>
    <LI>specify which data cubes are averaged together in the
      end, and</LI>
    <LI>give a title for the hardcopy that is created.</LI>
  </UL>
  Of course, the most important step in the deconvolution
  is the reconstruction of diffraction-limited images, but you don't
  have to care about that.  The whole procedure is started by clicking
  on "Deconvolution".
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="Assigns-Dec.gif">
  <P>
  The first step is to change the assignments of object and sky
  files.  During the calculation of the modulus of the fourier
  transformed image, the power spectrum of the sky will be subtracted
  from the power spectra of object and reference to reduce the noise.
  This works best if the sky subtracted from the object is taken from
  the same data cube as the object itself.  The same is true for the
  reference and its sky.  Mcspeckle will try to set the right
  assignments by executing the "Same Sky-#" function.  If this is
  right, just click on "Next Step" to go on.
  </P>
  <IMG SRC="Background.gif">
  <P>
  In this step, a linear background is fit to the images and
  subtracted from them.  A rectangular box around the object is
  excluded from the fit.  After the subtraction of the background, a
  subframe with the position and size of the box are cut out.  In
  other words: the borders outside of the box are thrown away.  These
  borders are replaced later by interpolated values to reduce the
  noise in the fourier-transformed images (due to the nature of the
  discrete fourier-transform, the images are repeated to fill the
  plane in normal space.  The interpolation ensures that there are no
  edges between the images).
  <P>
  The boxes will initially be centered on
  the center of light of the average frame of each data cube.
  <KBD>Ds9</KBD> is used again to show the average frame and the box.
  If <KBD>ds9</KBD> isn't already running, it will be started, but the
  box will sometimes not be displayed.  In this case, you have to
  click on the first file in the mcspeckle-window to redisplay it.
  The box is a standard <KBD>ds9</KBD>-region, so you can change its
  position by clicking in it and dragging it around.  If you click in
  it, small squares will appear at the corners that allow you to
  change the size.  To tell mcspeckle to ask <KBD>ds9</KBD> for the
  new box position and size, you have to click on "Change Box".
  Otherwise mcspeckle doesn't know
  that you changed the box and will use the old position and size!
  When you checked all boxes, click on "Done".
  </P>
  <IMG SRC="Average-None.gif">
  <P>
  In the deconvolution process, all the frames in one data cube are
  used to compute one (fourier-transformed) image.  If you have more
  than one data cube, the images can be averaged together to give
  another image with improved signal to noise ratio.  In the next
  step, you decide which images should be averaged.  Initially, no
  average is defined.  To add one, click on the "Add" button.
  </P>
  <IMG SRC="Average-Datasets.gif">
  <P>
  In the window that appears, you can select all the data sets you
  want to have averaged.  You can either select them by filename, or
  by the objectname that is defined in the FITS-header.  Furthermore,
  you can enter the beginning of the filename used for the average
  files.  Different extensions will be appended to this name to denote
  the different files that are created.
  Finally, TeX and Postscript files will be created to give an overview
  of the results.  You can specify a headline for these files.
  </P>
  When you click on "Ok", the window used to select the datasets is
  closed, and a box is added to the deconvolution window that contains
  headline and filename of the average frames.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="Average-One.gif">
  <P>
  You can define more average frames to be computed (for example, if
  you reduced observations of different objects in one go).  To start
  the deconvolution, click on "Go!".  Again, the text output of the
  programs that do the work is sent to the window where mcspeckle was
  started.  Since the deconvolution usually takes several hours and
  produces a lot of debugging output, it is also saved in the file
  "Deconvol.log".
  <P>
  If you use the button "Run in Bg" instead, the deconvolution will
  run in the background, and mcspeckle will exit.  The output is
  written to "Deconvol.log" only.
  </P>
  If you click on "Done", the Makefile will be finished without
  starting the deconvolution.  You can then quit mcspeckle and start
  the deconvolution by typing
  <PRE>
    ./Makefile >& Deconvol.log &
  </PRE>
  When the deconvolution is done, you can restart mcspeckle to look at
  the results with
  <PRE>
    mcspeckle Main.grp
  </PRE>

  <H3>Viewing the Results</H3>

  If all went well, the mcspeckle-window will have an additional
  button named "Results":
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="Main-Results.gif">
  <P>
  If you click on it, another window will open:
  </P>
  <IMG SRC="Inspect-Results.gif">
  <P>
  This window should contain one box for each set of average frames
  that were created.  The Display-button is a menu that allows you to
  display the Postscript- and the FITS-files.  The FITS-files will be
  displayed in <KBD>ds9</KBD>, while the viewer you selected during
  installation is used for Postscript.  <A HREF="H66665.ps">Here</A>
  is an example for the Postscript-file.
  <P>
  For each object data cube, there will be one row showing the
  visibility (the modulus of the fourier-transformed image), and the
  phase computed via the Knox-Thompson-algorithm and the
  bispectrum-method.  The phase computed from the bispectrum is
  usually better than that obtained from the Knox-Thompson-algorithm,
  but it also requires more CPU-time.  Furthermore, it is always
  useful to check the result of one method against the other.
  The last row in the Postscript-file shows the averaged files.
  This should look similar to a b/w version of this:
  <P>
  <img src="H66665_tvis.gif">
  <img src="H66665_ktph.gif">
  <img src="H66665_biph.gif">
  <P>
  The full data set of the example is 166 MBytes big, so we decided
  to put only a subset on the web.  The signal-to-noise ratio of this
  subset is significantly worse, so the result won't look as pretty as
  shown here.
  The visibility shows the fringe pattern characteristic for a binary,
  while the phase is nearly a step function, where the jumps are at
  points corresponding to minima of the modulus.  Since the bispectrum
  method requires a lot of computing time, we calculate the phase only
  within a circular area.
  </P>
  Since this star is a binary, the next step is to
  <A HREF="binfit.html">measure its parameters</A>.
