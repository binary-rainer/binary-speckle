  <H1> Finding the parameters of a binary </H1>

  If you suspect the star to be a binary (or even triple), you should
  call <KBD>binplot</KBD>.  This can be done from within mcspeckle or
  from the command line.  If you do it from the command line, you
  should first create a subdirectory, since a lot of files for
  different fits will be created.  Mcspeckle does this and calls it
  "Fits", but the name doesn't matter.  Then go to that subdirectory
  and type
  <PRE>
    binplot
  </PRE>
  Currently, mcspeckle can't pass any filenames to <KBD>binplot</KBD>,
  so it will come up with an empty plot window and its control window:
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="binplot-ctl1.gif">
  <P>
  You should first load the visibility by selecting "Visibility" in
  the "Load" menu.  If the delta file of the file you selected can be
  found, it will also be loaded.  Furthermore, <KBD>binplot</KBD>
  tries to guess a reasonable title for the hardcopy you get in the
  end.  This is based on the OBJECT and DATE keywords in the
  FITS-header of the file.
  </P>
  Here we use the star RXJ 1602.9-2022 as example (see Koehler et
  al. 2000).  The data files are in the Doc subdirectory of the
  package.  This star shows some typical problems of the fitting
  procedure, so we decided not to use H66665 here.  The results of my
  fits to the H66665 data are included with the example, so you can
  try to do the fits and compare your results to mine.
  </P>
  So, when you load <KBD>RXJ1602.9.fits_tvis</KBD> as visibility, you
  should see a 1-dimensional projection of the visibility in the
  plot-window:
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="binplot-vis1.gif">
  <P>
  The red points mark the data, the green line is the model, ignore it
  for the moment.  This 1D projection is obtained from the 2D date
  by projecting the data onto one axis, i.e. averaging over the axis
  perpendicular to it.  This is not a simple cut through the image, it
  really means adding all pixels in one direction and then dividing by
  the number of pixels.  The projection axis doesn't have to be the x-
  or y-axis of the image.
  To see the binary better, we have to set the angle
  of this projection to the position angle of the binary.  The easiest
  way to do this is by using the "Projection Dial", which can be
  opened with an item in the "Projects" menu:
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="ProjectDial.gif">
  <P>
  This is the 2D visibility plus a circle and two lines.  The circle
  marks the part of the image that is used to compute the 1D plot.
  Features smaller than the diffraction limit of the telescope cannot
  be reconstructed.  The diffraction limit corresponds to a certain
  spatial frequency in Fourier space.  For frequencies larger than
  this, our data does not contain any information about the object
  observed, but only noise.  However, the radius where the
  signal-to-noise ratio becomes too bad depends not only on the
  diffraction limit of the telescope, but also on the atmospheric
  conditions during the observations.  Therefore one has to inspect
  the data and set the maximum radius accordingly.  There is
  also a minimum radius.  However, this is not visible in the
  projection dial if it is zero.  To change the radius, you can simply
  click on the circle and drag it with the mouse, the plot should
  change immediately (you have to click on the red line, not just
  somewhere inside the circle).
  <P>
  The shorter line is the direction in which the pixels are averaged.
  The long line with the arrow at one end is always perpendicular to
  it and essentially marks the X-axes of the 1D plot, with the arrow
  pointing in +X direction.  The projection angle can be changed by
  clicking and dragging on the lines.
  </P>
  The characteristic stripe pattern of a binary is perpendicular to
  its position angle.  If the shorter of the red lines is parallel to
  the stripes, the projection angle is equal to the position angle.
  You can also drag the projection angle around and watch the 1D plot.
  If the amplitude of the curve reaches its maximum, you are at the
  position angle of the binary.
  <P>
  Now we try to find an initial model for the binary that can be used
  as starting point for the fitting programs.  We already have a good
  guess for the position angle, you can copy this value to the angle
  of the first companion by selecting "Proj.->Comp.1" in the "Set
  Angle" menu.  You can also use the entry for "Position Angle" in the
  "Estimate" menu, albeit this will probably give the same result.
  </P>
  To get initial separation and brightness, you can use the
  corresponding entry in the "Estimate" menu.  In some cases, this
  gives good values, in many other cases, it is just wrong.  (This is
  the reason why we still stick with the cumbersome fitting procedure
  and not use the algorithms behind the "Estimate" menu").  You can
  also use the entry fields or sliders for companion 1.  Remember:
  The period of the wave corresponds to the separation, where shorter
  separations give shorter periods.  The amplitude corresponds to the
  flux ratio of the binary, or the brightness of the companion, if the
  primary is normalized to one.
  <P>
  Another important parameter is "Visibility Factor".  The visibility
  is normalized so that it is 1.0 at spatial frequency 0.0.  This
  means the brightness of the primary is 1.0 by definition.  The other
  maxima of the visibility should also be 1.0.  However, in real life
  this is not always the case, since this normalization is based on
  one single pixel and therefore very sensitive to noise.  To
  compensate this, the data is multiplied by the visibility factor.
  </P>
  A good initial model for this example binary would look like this:
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="binplot-vis2.gif">
  <P>
  The settings in the control window are shown here:
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="binplot-ctl2.gif">
  <P>
  Note that there are controls for a second companion, but its
  brightness is set to zero.  They are used for triple stars.
  </P>
  Now we can start the fitting program.  You can use the
  <KBD>amf</KBD> or the <KBD>bff</KBD> program.  The latter stands for
  "brute force fit", since it simply computes many models on a grid
  around the starting point and uses the best fit as new starting
  point for a smaller grid.  This is repeated until the grid is
  sufficienctly small.  Of course, this needs a lot of CPU time.
  Trying to fit a triple star can easily take more than a week.
  The amoeba algorithm used in <KBD>amf</KBD> is much faster (it needs
  a few minutes for a triple star), therefore I strongly recommend
  using it.
  <P>
  Both <KBD>amf</KBD> and bff can and should be started from the
  "File" menu.  You are asked to give a filename for the
  <KBD>bff</KBD>-file, that is the input file for both <KBD>amf</KBD>
  and <KBD>bff</KBD>.  The default is <KBD>Vis.bff</KBD>, because
  we are fitting to the visibility only for now.  Then
  <KBD>binplot</KBD> will start an editor to let you edit the file.
  It will use the contents of the VISUAL environment variable, this
  should contain an editor that is able to open its own window.
  <P>
  The <KBD>bff</KBD>-file consists of comments (lines starting with #)
  and "keyword = value" pairs.  The keywords should be
  self-explanatory.  You will recognize the filenames of visibility
  and delta file, the title, the radius (min and max), and the
  parameters for the binary model.  The latter contain two values.  If
  you use <KBD>bff</KBD>, they give the range of values that will be
  scanned in the first pass.  For <KBD>amf</KBD>, one point of the
  simplex will have the first values of all parameters as coordinates.
  The other points are obtained by using the second value of one
  parameter each time.  Initially, both
  values will be the same, so you should change at least one of them.
  </P>
  It takes a bit of experience to decide which values to use, and the
  only advice I can give is this:  If you are not sure that you picked
  a good starting value for a parameter,
  you should choose a larger difference so that a larger range is
  scanned during the fitting procedure.  On the other hand, the values
  entered here should not be very important for the final result, they
  mainly determine how many iterations have to be computed to find it.
  A rule of thumb is to start with scan ranges of about 0.5 degrees in
  position angle, 0.1 pixels in separation, and 0.1 in flux ratio
  (brightness).  Here are the relevant parts of my edited
  <KBD>bff</KBD>-file:
  <PRE>
  #
  # /home/koehler/Projects/Binary-Speckle/Doc/Fits/Vis.bff	created by binplot from Dec  5 2000
  #
  visib   = /home/koehler/Projects/Binary-Speckle/Doc/RXJ1602.9.fits_tvis
  dvisib  = /home/koehler/Projects/Binary-Speckle/Doc/RXJ1602.9.fits_dtvis

  title   = RXJ1602.9 on 2.May 1994

  ce_ang  = 0.000000 10.000000
  ce_dist = 0.000000 10.
  angle1  = 4.280673 4.
  dist1   = 6.400000 6.5
  brightn1= 0.781991 0.7
  radius  = 0 42

  bff_out = *.bffo
  fit_out = *.fit
  </PRE>
  The last two lines give the names of the output files, where the *
  will be replaced by the name of the input file (without the
  <KBD>.bff</KBD>).  The first file is in the same format as the input
  file, while the second is in the format of the fit-program that was
  used before <KBD>binplot</KBD> was invented.
  <P>
  If you exit the editor, <KBD>binplot</KBD>'s control-window will be
  iconized and <KBD>amf</KBD> or <KBD>bff</KBD> started.  When the
  fit-program is finished, <KBD>binplot</KBD> reads the
  <KBD>.fit</KBD>-file and adjusts its settings accordingly.  Since
  our example binary is a very easy case, the result of the fit
  doesn't look much different than the input.  In more difficult
  cases, the result will be different.
  <P>
  The next step is to load one of the phases, usually that computed
  using the Knox-Thompson-algorithm (it is in the file with extension
  "ktph").  Our example is quite typical - we picked the wrong
  position angle.  Since the modulus of the fourier transformed image
  is symmetrical, we can't tell if the secondary is to the left or the
  right of the primary.  However, the phase tells unambiguously that
  we got it wrong:
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="binplot-viskt1.gif">
  <P>
  We just have to add 180 degress to the position angle, but since
  computers are there to do the computations, there is an entry in the
  "Set Angle" menu that does it for us.
  <P>
  The result looks good, but you can try to play with the position of
  the center to improve it.  Because of the way the
  phase-reconstruction algorithms work, the center of light should be
  centered on the image, but this is based on three pixels for x and
  y.  Like the normalization of the visibility, this is not always
  right.  The "Center" entry in the "Estimate" menu fits a plane to
  the difference between the phase of the data and the model and
  computes the corresponding shift of the center.  You should call
  it several times until it converges.  (Since a phase of pi is the
  same as -pi, there is always an ambiguity when one computes
  difference of phases.  Therefore the estimate works better if the
  differences are small (much smaller than pi), e.g. if one starts
  from a previous estimated position).
  <P>
  Now you can call <KBD>amf</KBD> or <KBD>bff</KBD> again.  This time
  it will probably take more time to run, since it has to compute
  differences for visibility and phase.  After a while,
  <KBD>binplot</KBD> will show the result:
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="binplot-viskt2.gif">
  <P>
  This is far from being optimal.  The reason is that the phase
  reconstruction had problems to get the second step right.  The best
  way out in this case is to reduce the maximal radius to about 31
  pixels to exclude the bad parts of the phase.  Then start
  <KBD>amf</KBD> or <KBD>bff</KBD> again.  The result looks like this:
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="binplot-viskt3.gif">
  <P>
  This is about as good as one can expect.  You can now create a
  hardcopy of the result with "Print" in the "File" menu.
  <P>
  To check if there are more companions, we use the
  <KBD>maxbright</KBD> program again.  To do this, we first have to
  subtract the model of the first companion from the data.  This is
  not the same as subtracting the model from the data, since
  <KBD>maxbright</KBD> expects to get data <EM>with</EM> the primary,
  so we have to subtract only the contribution of the secondary.  It
  is done with "Save without Comp." in the "File" menu.  It will ask
  for the names of all the files it is going to write.
  </P>
  Next you can repeat the fitting procedure with the phase constructed
  from the bispectrum.  It is usually a good idea to start with the
  result of the fit to the visibility without phase (there is an item
  in the "File" menu to read a fit-file).  This is especially
  important with our example binary, since the bispectrum-method was
  able to reconstruct the second step in the phase function, so we can
  use the larger fit radius.  The fitting procedure should be
  straightforward.
  <P>
  When saving the data without the companion, you have to decide if
  you want to overwrite the visibility based on the fit to the
  Knox-Thompson phase.  I do this if the fit to the bispectrum-phase
  is better (which it usually is).
  <P>
  Now you can call <KBD>maxbright</KBD> using the corresponding item
  in the "File" menu.  <KBD>Binplot</KBD> will give it the names of
  the data files without the companion and the radius of the fit.
  The results of <KBD>maxbright</KBD> for binaries (after the
  subtraction of a companion) are on average better than for
  unresolved stars.  I think this is not real (why should the data of
  binaries be systematically better than that of unresolved stars?)
  but related to the fitting procedure.  The fitting programs try to
  minimize the difference between model and data (which has errors),
  so the residuals after the fit will be smaller than if one subtracts
  a model with the exact parameters of the real binary.
  <P>
  To estimate the errors of the parameters of the binary, we make fits
  to the results of single data cubes.  There is a program called
  <KBD>mkbffs</KBD> to make this easier.  To use it, quit binplot and
  type (in the Fits subdirectory)
  <PRE>
    mkbffs ../Badpix.grp
  </PRE>
  Its window looks like this:
  <P>
  <Img src="mkbffs.gif">
  <P>
  You can select the data cubes you want to use and the parameter
  ranges.  It shows the results of all <KBD>.fit</KBD> files in the
  directory and picks the minimum and maximum of each parameter.
  If you picked the wrong position angle for the fit to the
  visibility, its range will span about 180 degrees.  This is not very
  reasonable, so you should correct this by hand.  The other ranges
  are usually usable.
  <P>
  If you click on "Write bffs", bff-files for all the datacubes are
  written.  If you click on "Write & amf" or "Write & bff", the same
  bff-files are written, but amf or bff is started for each of them.
  After that, mkbffs will create a file with all the results and
  mean and error values.  Finally, it starts your editor on this file
  (the environment variable VISUAL is used as the name of the editor).
  Here are my results of the example data of HIP66665:

  </PRE>
  The 180 degree ambiguity of the visibility strikes again, we have to
  calculate the mean position angle and its error ourselves.
  Generally, we quote the mean value of Bi/KT/Vis.fit and the larger
  of the error.  So in this case, the final result would be:
  <UL>
    <LI>Position angle: (165.0 +/- 2.8) degrees</LI>
    <LI>Separation: (3.10 +/- 0.14) pixels</LI>
    <LI>Flux ratio: 0.4861 +/- 0.0232</LI>
  </UL>
  The precision is not very good, but the example data set contains
  only 100 frames of the object.
